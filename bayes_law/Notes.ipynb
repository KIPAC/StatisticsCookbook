    "## 1. Introduction to Bayes Law\n",
    "Bayes law is a simple but powerful tool in statistics – indeed, a whole subfield of statistics has been named after it! We will see in the following notes and examples how this powerful tool may be used in a variety of problems. In brief, Bayes rule tells us how to update our \"beliefs\", or the probability we assign to a certain thing being true, based on new information that we collect – new \"data\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Review of basic probability definitions\n",
    "A random variable is a variable whose value results from a random process, such as measuring a quantity that exhibits random variation. For example, the flux measured from a star will fluctuate due to processes in the atmosphere and detectors which introduce variation. In this way, the random variable can take on a set of possible values, each with some associated probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of some event a will be denoted $p(a)$ -- a canonical example of such an event is the outcome of a toin toss, e.g. a denotes heads, so $p(a)$ is the probability of getting heads when tossing your coin. Note that we could also assign a probability to a continuous event, e.g. the event is the value of a continuous variable falling in some finite interval around $b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two events a and b, we denote the probability that they are both true as $p(a,b)$. This is called the _joint_ probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**need marginal probability $p(a) = \\int p(a,b)db$**\n",
    "\n",
    "We also may define a conditional probability: this is relevant for two events which are _dependent_ on each other, and gives the probability that one event will happen *in the case that the other event also happened*. For instance, the statement $p(a|b)=0.5$ tells us that if event $b$ is true, there is a 50% chance that event $a$ is also true. \n",

    "\n",
    "For legibility, we will define some more quantities according to this 2x2 table. For instance, $p(G=0|M=1) = \\epsilon_{FP}$. This corresponds to a positive match but an innocent accused – we can think of this as a false positive DNA test.\n",

In other words, one would need to make some statement about the guilt of the accused before seeing any evidence – not something we recommend when their innocence is on the line!*\n",

    "On the other hand, if $\\epsilon_{FN}<<\\epsilon_M$, which means the prevalence of the genetic marker is higher than the false negative rate, a positive match with the crime scene DNA becomes a more significant piece of evidence.\n",

    "- We often use probabilities informally to express our information and beliefs about unknown quantities. However, the use of probabilities to express infor- mation can be made formal: In a precise mathematical sense, it can be shown that probabilities can numerically represent a set of rational beliefs, that there is a relationship between probability and information, and that Bayes’ rule provides a rational method for updating beliefs in light of new information. \n",
    "- After a dataset y is obtained, the information it contains can be used to decrease our uncertainty about the population characteristics. \n",
    "- The sample space Y is the set of all possible datasets, from which a single dataset y will result. The parameter space Θ is the set of possible parameter values, from which we hope to identify the value that best represents the true population characteristics. \n",
    "- For each numerical value θ ∈ Θ, our prior distribution p(θ) describes our belief that θ represents the true population characteristics. 2. For each θ ∈ Θ and y ∈ Y, our sampling model p(y|θ) describes our belief that y would be the outcome of our study if we knew θ to be true. Once we obtain the data y, the last step is to update our beliefs about θ: 3. For each numerical value of θ ∈ Θ, our posterior distribution p(θ|y) describes our belief that θ is the true value, having observed dataset y. \n",
    "- It is important to note that Bayes’ rule does not tell us what our beliefs should be, it tells us how they should change after seeing new information\n",
    "- Bayes’ rule is an optimal method of updating this person’s beliefs about θ given new infor- mation y.\n",
    "- (the posterior) is more peaked than p(θ) because it combines information from the data and the prior distribution, and thus contains more information than in p(θ) alone"
